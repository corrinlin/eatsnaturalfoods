			<h2>Green Home</h2>
			<p>From household cleaning products to baking supplies, Eats strives to provide the highest quality products. There are some brands of “natural” cleaners you will not find here, because we simply do not trust that they are truly earth friendly. We do our research when it comes to ingredients.

			We feel that besides being environmentally sound, products need to actually work. That’s why we test products ourselves and if we find them to be inferior, we simply stop carrying them.</p>
