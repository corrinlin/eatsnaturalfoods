			<h2>Green Home</h2>
			<p>From household cleaning products to baking supplies, Eats strives to provide the highest quality products. We do our research when it comes to ingredients and only stock brands of cleaners that we trust to be truly earth friendly. We feel that besides being environmentally sound, products need to actually work. Thatâ€™s why we test the products ourselves and only continue to carry those that do.</p>
