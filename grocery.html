				<h3>Meats</h3>
				<p>Due to customer demand, we have decided to reevaluate the meat selection at EATS. Our new standards for meat include: all meat must be USDA Organic or raised without use of antibiotics, hormones, or chemicals; all animals must be humanely treated, pasture-finished (no feedlots) and raised on a free-range farm; and all fish is wild-caught and sustainably harvested with 3rd party certification. You may notice that some products have been replaced or discontinued; this is because we have found them to be incompatible with these new standards. We wish to provide our customers with healthy protein sources by supporting farmers with strong values in animal husbandry.</p>

				<p>If you wish to learn more about the farms and farmers whose products we currrently carry, please ask to see our Eats Meats binder!</p>
