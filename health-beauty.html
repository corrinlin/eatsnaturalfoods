				<h3>Vitamins and Supplements</h3>
				<p>Eats carries a large selection of nutritional supplements and herbs from reputable companies. We check our vendors carefully and only carry products from companies that meet our high standards. We are always looking at new products but, only pick them up if we feel they are safe and effective. In this vein we do not carry many diet products because most of them we have found do not work.

				The main brands that we carry are Now, Natures Plus, Source Naturals/Planatary Herbal, New Chapter, Nature’s Way, Carlsons, Nordic Naturals, Irwin Naturals, and Renew Life. We have some products from Twinlabs, Schiff, Rainbow Light and order products from many other companies.

				Our staff is friendly and knowledgeable and will try to answer your questions or direct you to reference books to help.</p>

				<h3>Personal Care</h3>
				<p>At Eats we try to carry a good variety of the traditional natural personal care products, organic products, and newer products that are clean and good. As with most areas of natural health, personal care is ever-changing, what is dangerous and what is good. We do our best to stay updated on the current news and reflect our purchases accordingly. We do many special orders for personal care, so if we don’t carry your favorite product, we might be able to order it for you and get it here in a week or so.</p>
