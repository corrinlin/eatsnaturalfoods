			<h2>Beer and Wine Making</h2>
			<p>Eats carries a large selection of equipment for making beer & wine. We carry fermenting jugs from 1-25 gallons, airlocks, bottling buckets, hydrometers, bottles cappers & corkers, and much more. We also carry various chemicals for fermenting and a large selection of yeast for making beer and wine.

			We stock and can order a wide variety of grains for making beer from malt syrup to 50# bags of grains. We also carry many beer kits that are quick and easy to use. You can have 6 gallons of beer ready to ferment in 30 minutes.

			Wine kits are so numerous, we only stock a couple, and most people order them from us in advance. It usually takes 1 to 2 weeks to get them in from our suppliers.

			We also have many books for making beer and wine, liquors, herbal beers, meade, and much more. So, come in and check it out.  If you have questions, our staff is happy to help, as best they can.

			If you would like to place a special order you can browse our LD Carlson & BSG Handcraft catalogs then give us a call. We order from two different distributers each carrying some products the other does not.

			(Coopers beer ingredient kits are only available through BSG Handcraft while White Labs liquid yeast is only available through LD Carlson Company.)</p>
