				<h3>Meats</h3>
				<p>Due to customer demand, we have decided to reevaluate the meat selection at EATS. These new standards include, all meat must be USDA Organic or raised without use of antibiotics, hormones, or chemicals. All animals must be humanely treated, pasture-finished (no feedlots) and raised on a free-range farm. All fish is wild-caught and sustainably harvested with 3rd party certification. You may notice that some products have been replaced or discontinued, this is because we have found them to be incompatible with these standards. We wish to provide our customers with healthy protein sources by supporting farmers with strong values in animal husbandry.

				If you wish to learn more about the farms and farmers whose products we are currently carrying, please ask to see our Eats Meats binder!</p>
