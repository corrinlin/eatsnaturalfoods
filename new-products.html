				<h3>Gluten-Free</h3>
				<p>We have a large variety of ever changing gluten-free products. As a celiac, and the grocery orderer of the gluten-free products, I love to try new and improved goodies. Let me know if you can’t find your favorites and I’ll see if we can get it. I try to stock a good amount of baking, cooking, breakfast and snack items to replace those with gluten. We are in the process of tagging the other aisles with blue “GF” signs for items that have Gluten Free on their packaging for easy shopping. Let me know if I can help. -Hannah</p>

				<h3>Gourmet Foods</h3>
				<p>At Eats, we strive to provide the very best in gourmet products. Satisfy your chocolate craving with our premium dark or milk chocolates, or check out our wide array of olives, both packaged and in bulk. We package many of our products ourselves so we can provide the highest quality products at reasonable prices. While we’re getting your bulk Kalamata olives or feta, be sure to sample the many cheeses that fit the ‘gourmet’ billing. 
				Because of our fine cheese selection, we feel that the crackers we offer must live up to that reputation and be complimentary. While remaining loyal to old mainstays, we are always on the lookout for new, quality crackers and accoutrement.</p>
